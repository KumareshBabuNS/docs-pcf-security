This guide is intended for administrators, developers, and anyone interested in making their Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment more secure. Use this guide to learn how PCF manages infrastructure security, roles and permissions, container hardening, and more.

To learn about Pivotal's vulnerability reporting and responsible disclosure process, read the [PCF Security Overview and Policy](./process/pcf-security.html). You can review the latest CVEs on the [Pivotal Application Security page](https://pivotal.io/security). 

If you are new to PCF security, start with the <a href="#concepts">Concepts</a> section.
