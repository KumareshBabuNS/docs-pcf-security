This topic explains how Pivotal’s development practices, automated build tools, and organizational structures work together to create and support stable releases of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## Summary 
<!-- This used to read "Key Takeaways," but I thought that language was more marketing-facing than documentation-appropriate -->
* PCF follows a disciplined software development lifecycle that builds in quality and reduces feedback cycle time for teams producing system components. 
* Every PCF release follows a strict workflow and passes through numerous quality and compliance gates before distribution. 
* Tests are built into the product from the moment code is added, and run automatically with any code change.

## Release Mechanics
### Versioning
Pivotal numbers PCF releases following a [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) style format, _X.Y.Z_, where _X_ and _Y_ indicate major and minor releases, and _Z_ designates patch releases. Major and minor releases change PCF functionality, while patch releases are backward-compatible security patches or bug fixes.

### Support
As of PCF 1.8, Pivotal supports each major and minor PCF release for a duration determined as follows:

* Pivotal supports the release for at least 9 months following its first publication date.
* Pivotal supports the last three major or minor releases, even if this extends coverage beyond 9 months. 

Versions of PCF prior to 1.8 are subject to a different support lifecycle policy. Pivotal projects supporting PCF versions 1.8, 1.7, and 1.6 as follows: 

<!-- I changed these column names for clarity -->

<table class="nice">
<th>PCF Release</th>
<th>Release Date</th>
<th>End of Support</th>
<th>Lifecycle</th>
<tr>
	<td>1.8.x</td>
	<td>8/29/16</td>
	<td>6/30/17</td>
	<td>9 months (projected)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>1.7.x</td>
	<td>4/29/16</td>
	<td>4/30/17</td>
	<td>12 months (projected, likely longer)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>1.6.x</td>
	<td>10/26/15</td>
	<td>4/30/17</td>
	<td>> 12 months</td>
</tr>
</table>

Support includes maintenance updates and upgrades, bug and security fixes, and technical assistance. The [Pivotal Support Policy](https://pivotal.io/support/lifecycle_policy) describes support (“General Support”) and related guidance and publication phases in more detail. The Pivotal Support Services [Terms and Conditions](https://pivotal.io/support/support_terms_conditions) defines Pivotal support in legal terms.

### Patch Releases
Patch releases are more frequent and less predictable than major/minor releases. The v1.6.x line provides a good example of their frequency. PCF 1.6.1 first posted on October 26, 2015. Through August 2016, 36 additional patches of Elastic Runtime 1.6.x and 18 patches of Ops Manager 1.6.x provided security and bug fixes to customers.

Each release is accompanied by release notes for [Ops Manager](../../pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html) and Elastic Runtime 
which document the security and bug fixes that they include. If a patch release contains security fixes in core Cloud Foundry code or in packaged dependencies, the release notes call them out using security identifiers from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Ubuntu Security Notices (USN), and other 3rd party sources. Additionally, [pivotal.io/security](https://pivotal.io/security) maintains a running list of security fixes in PCF and PCF dependencies.
