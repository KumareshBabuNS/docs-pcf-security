This section introduces some of the networking and routing security options for your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

## Securing Traffic and Controlling Routes

You can enable and configure a number of customization options to secure traffic in and out of your PCF deployment.

* [Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/securing-traffic.html)
* [Providing a Certificate for Your SSL/TLS Termination Point](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/security_config.html)
* [Enabling TCP Routing](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html)


## Using the IPsec Add-On

The IPsec add-on for PCF provides additional security to the network layer for each BOSH-deployed virtual machine (VM).

The PCF IPsec add-on secures network traffic within a Cloud Foundry deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall.
